## My process

### Built with

- A little bit of flexbox
- Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first time using javascript to pull data from a file to display on the DOM with everything done on the client side, at least for a while, that I can remember. It was a lot easier than I thought it would be, or remembered it to be.
